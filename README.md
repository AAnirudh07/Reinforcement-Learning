# Reinforcement-Learning
The repository contains the implementations for the following:

  1. Q-Learning with the [MountainCar-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/#:~:text=A%20car%20is%20on%20a,forth%20to%20build%20up%20momentum.) test environment.
  2. [Sample Efficient Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER)](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/acer.html) with the [LunarLander-v2](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/) test environment.
  3. Deep Q-Learning using Convolutional Neural Networks.
